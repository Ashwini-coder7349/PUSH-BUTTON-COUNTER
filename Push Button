Components Needed:
Arduino Uno (or any compatible Arduino board)
Push button
10k立 resistor
16x2 LCD display
Breadboard and jumper wires

Circuit Diagram:
Push Button:
Connect one leg of the push button to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 2).
Connect the other leg of the push button to the ground (GND).
Connect a 10k立 resistor between the digital pin (e.g., pin 2) and the 5V supply to act as a pull-up resistor.

LCD Display:
Connect the LCD pins to the Arduino as follows:
RS to digital pin 12
E to digital pin 11
D4 to digital pin 5
D5 to digital pin 4
D6 to digital pin 3
D7 to digital pin 2
Connect the VSS pin of the LCD to GND.
Connect the VDD pin of the LCD to 5V.
Connect the V0 pin of the LCD to the middle pin of a 10k立 potentiometer (for contrast adjustment), with the other two pins of the potentiometer connected to 5V and GND.
Connect the RW pin of the LCD to GND.
Connect the A (anode) pin of the LCD backlight to 5V through a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220立).
Connect the K (cathode) pin of the LCD backlight to GND.

Arduino Code:
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// Initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins
LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);

const int buttonPin = 2;  // Pin where the push button is connected
int buttonState = 0;      // Variable for reading the push button status
int lastButtonState = 0;  // Variable to store the last button state
int count = 0;            // Variable to store the count of button presses

void setup() {
  // Set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd.print("Button Presses:");
  
  // Initialize the push button pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the state of the push button value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // Check if the button is pressed
  if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
      // If the current state is HIGH then the button was pressed
      count++;
      // Clear the second row of the LCD
      lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
      lcd.print("                ");
      // Set the cursor to the second row, first column
      lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
      // Print the count of button presses
      lcd.print(count);
    }
    // Save the current state as the last state, for next time through the loop
    lastButtonState = buttonState;
  }
}
